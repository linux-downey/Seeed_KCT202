# Seeed grove air602 UART wifi

## Introduction
The KCT202 is a integrated fingerprint,which based on BYD's fingerprint sensor BF5325 and a cortex M4 MCU GD32FFPRTG


## Notice
* Since atmega328(like arduino UNO) has only one serial port,The library use hardware serial port to output log info,and control the fingerprint sensor via softserial(2,3)ï¼ŒSo the grove cable should attach to (D2,D3) port. The log serial's baudrate default 115200,The transport serial's baudrate fixed 57600.   


* When using the samd board(like arduino zero,seeeduino cortex M0+),the SerialUSB for printing log info.The Serial(defined in library)for send AT command.
